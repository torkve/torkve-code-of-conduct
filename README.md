# Torkve's Code of Conduct
Code of Conduct for the people who still write code rather than do politics.

Modern world is kinda full of hatred and cancel culture. 

Many people forgot about what is Open Software about, they prefer to establish Communities
and hail their own soft skills, rather than write code and improve the world.

That's why I had to establish my own Code of Conduct. Its main goal is to provide support
for people who can do great things, but cannot (or do not want to) show off their talking
skills.

If you want to make things better, no matter how badass (or you believe that) your teammates
are, and don't care what are their skin color, political beliefs, gender, religion,
language, and shoe size (all the same applies to yourself as well), than you should choose
my Code of Conduct.

Feel free to take it and apply to your project.

And we also have ~~cookies~~ shiny badges:
